**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Over the past decade, research in the NUAI lab is paving a path to revolutionize the next generation of intelligent platforms. We strive to achieve this through an interdisciplinary research approach. The fundamental questions that we strive to answer include:
* *Can our understanding of human neural processing and perception lead to new AI algorithms and hardware advances?*
*  *How can we design AI that learns continually through its lifetime? Can we achieve this in a resource efficient manner?*

Our team has developed new brain-inspired algorithms, AI platforms, and energy efficient machine learning substrates. Our research lab takes pride in fostering a highly stimulating student-centric research environment.
The key research areas in the lab are
1. Lifelong Learning
2. Neuromorphic Accelerator development
3. Plasticity in Spiking Neural Networks
4. Model Compression
5. Emerging Technologies
6. Edge Computing Applications

Students interested in the NUAI Lab should first read through the lab research areas available on the [NuAI lab website](https://www.nuailab.com/index.html#) prior to contacting [Dr. Kudithipudi](dk@utsa.edu) by email.
